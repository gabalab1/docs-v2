# The Shannon Upgrade

The upcoming Shannon upgrade will transform POKT Network from a leading DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure) with full supply-side decentralization and an empowered community into the first true sharing economy for any open data-source.&#x20;

It will accelerate key changes that are already taking place at POKT Network.

Including:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Permissionless Gateways" %}
Shannon takes our Gateway strategy for decentralized demand-side access and makes the creation of Gateways fully permissionless, enabling rapid volume growth by becoming a fully open and universal RPC infra layer.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Improved Scalability" %}
Shannon removes the remaining limitations on the protocolâ€™s scalability and brings interoperability with key ecosystems in Web3, opening us up fully to the rest of our world.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="New Usescases" %}
Shannon takes the Data Source expansion that we started in Morse and introduces tokenomics that enable monetization for the Data Sources themselves. This accelerates our expansion into new use cases and provides a new sustainable incentive model for open Data Sources of all kinds.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

These documents are what you can expect from this major upgrade.

Some of the content of this 'Shannon' section requires DAO approval before it could take affect. We're sharing here so that everyone has full transparency on what we're currently thinking.&#x20;
