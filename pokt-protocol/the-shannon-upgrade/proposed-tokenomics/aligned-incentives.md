# Aligned Incentives

In the current version of the POKT Network protocol, Morse, top performing node runners are focused on taking advantage of ServiceIDs with imbalance (a high relay to node ratio). With the Shannon upgrade we have the potential to ensure that the most performant node runners will be those that seek balance.

This slight shift in incentives, means that network balance is achieved by focusing on balancing and not focusing on immediate opportunities of imbalance. This new alignment of incentives will provide a more stable Supplier ecosystem, and directly addresses gaming and self-dealing which are predicated on creating artificial network imbalance.
