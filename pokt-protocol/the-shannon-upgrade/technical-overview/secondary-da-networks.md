# Secondary DA Networks

Shannon is considering using other DA networks, such as Celestia, to enhance network security. Either on or after launch, Shannon will be able to do so using RollChains.

Shannon will launch with its own POKT Validators, but all blocks could also be published to Celestia. This dual security approach will be integral to enhance Shannonâ€™s security if other DA layers can provided a higher level of economic security.

In the future, POKT Network could delegate all network security and consensus to another DA layer. The modular blockchain space is still in its early stages, but with POKT Protocol being built on the Cosmos SDK, POKT Network has plenty of portability to move to other consensus systems in the future.
