# Expected Gaps

As we get closer to TestNet, and later MainNet, we will uncover missing gaps in the following:

* Utilities for Suppliers, Gateways & Developers (e.g. CLI utilities)
* Tools (e.g. tooling that has been built by the community)
* Metrics (e.g. on-chain data such as events that we no longer track)
* Endpoints (e.g. necessary OpenAPI spec)
* Incompatibilities (e.g. discussions that will result out of not being backwards cmopatible)
* Metrics or endpoints that we did not migrate from Morse to Shannon
