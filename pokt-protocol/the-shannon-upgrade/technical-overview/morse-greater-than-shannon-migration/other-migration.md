# Other Migration

#### Key Migration

* We will need to find a way to go for <mark style="color:red;">`ed25519`</mark> to <mark style="color:red;">`secp256k1`</mark> or discuss alternatives
* Open questions around migration of the wPOKT bridge

#### Ecosystem Migration

Since Morse â†’ Shannon is a rewrite, the wire protocol is different, so the ecosystem will need to prepare to migrate its tooling and infra. For example:

* Explorers
* Gateway-Server
* Staking Providers
* Exchanges
* Block selection for re-genesis
