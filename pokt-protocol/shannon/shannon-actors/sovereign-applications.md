# Sovereign Applications

## Sovereign Application Vision

Sovereign Applications want direct, cost effective, unstoppable access to raw data sources without the burden of running the heavy infrastructure required.

Shannon makes direct access to data sources possible in a permissionless fashion. While Gateways may bring more features beyond the POKT Protocol itself, many applications may have straightforward needs which could be served entirely through the protocol. Sovereign Applications only pay the cost of the relays themselves, since they only access the raw data sources, and do not utilize gateways for addition features.

Shannon is opening POKT Network up to this new market of use cases, fulfilling POKT Network's original mission to provide direct, permissionless, unstoppable data infrastructure to all edge applications, including those sitting in your pocket ðŸ˜‰
