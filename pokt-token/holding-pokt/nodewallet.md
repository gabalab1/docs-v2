# NodeWallet

[NodeWallet](https://docs.decentralizedauthority.com/nodewallet) is currently the best maintained online wallet for POKT. Open-source and browser-based, it was built by Decentralized Authority, the team behind [Node Pilot](https://nodepilot.tech/). NodeWallet was started as a [Pocket Open Priority (POP)](https://forum.pokt.network/t/allocated-priority-new-wallet) project funded by the Pocket Network Foundation.

NodeWallet has a "Stake" button that allows users to non-custodially stake with any participating node operator.

### NodeWallet features:

* Universal seed phrase importer (you can import seed phrases from other popular wallets, so you donâ€™t need a POKT-specific seed phrase for POKT addresses)
* Keyfile and private key importer
* Generate multiple POKT addresses within one NodeWallet wallet
* [wPOKT Bridge](https://wpokt.network/) compatible
* [Open source](https://github.com/decentralized-authority/nodewallet) with plug-in design to make it contributor friendly for adding features and expanding to other networks
* Utilizes [argon2id](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Password\_Storage\_Cheat\_Sheet.html) + [AES-256 GCM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced\_Encryption\_Standard) for quantum secure encryption
* All wallet data is encrypted then stored using `chrome.storage`, as is standard for [Chrome extension data storage](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/storage)

Install NodeWallet directly from the Chrome Store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nodewallet/ilibmadejjooogcniiomgdgbojkmlbim).
