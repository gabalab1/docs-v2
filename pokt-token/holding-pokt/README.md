# Holding POKT

Before buying any POKT, you should learn how to "store" it safely.&#x20;

In this section, we describe the different wallets you can use to "hold" and manage POKT.&#x20;

* [NodeWallet](./#nodewallet)
* [Pocket Wallet](./#pocket-wallet)
* [Ledger](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MVU655bEpKMcmpTxlOG/s/sC7vRmj1fRzIvz4vDUe3/)

Once Shannon is deployed to mainnet, POKT holders will have access to all Cosmos wallets, e.g., [Keplr](https://www.keplr.app/) and [Leap](https://www.leapwallet.io/).

NOTE: Crypto wallets technically donâ€™t store your crypto. Your tokens live on the blockchain where you access them using the private key that's stored in your wallet.
