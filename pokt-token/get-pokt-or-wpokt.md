## Over-the-Counter (OTC)

OTC trading desks are white-label markets operated by intermediaries who match buyers and sellers. They are typically used for large volume trades.

A number of OTC desks serve the POKT community and can be found [on the POKT forum.](https://forum.pokt.network/t/overview-of-otc-markets/629)

## Get wPOKT

To make POKT more available and widen its adoption we created wPOKT, an Ethereum Mainnet token that bridges to Pocket Network. It's most easily accessed via our Uniswap pool.

Our roadmap includes plans to make POKT available on other EVM bridges in the future.

wPOKT (wrapped POKT) is similar to WETH or WBTC. Find out about wrapped crypto generally [here](https://www.ledger.com/academy/what-is-wrapped-crypto).&#x20;
