# POKT Overview

## The universal RPC base layer token&#x20;

POKT coordinates ecosystem actors and powers the decentralized RPC network. Gateways and node runners use the token to service the ever-growing demand for on-chain data.

* Node runners must stake $POKT (between 15k and 60k POKT) to operate a single node.
* Gateways must pay an operator fee in $POKT per relay ($0.00000085).
* Every week the aggregated operator fees from Gateways are burned by the Pocket Network Foundation.

# Our DNA

### Our DNA Statement:

> #### _Pocket’s purpose is to power unstoppable open data and open infrastructure, governed by its users_&#x20;

POKT Network are the RPC base layer, or universal RPC infrastructure.

As of today, we incentivize and coordinate a decentralized network of operators to run a type of blockchain node (an RPC node) that enables applications to read / write to blockchains.

With one connection developers can access data from 50+ chains with low cost and high resilience.

We've been building since 2017 and operating on mainnet since 2020. Since then we've served almost 700 billion relays, through thousands of nodes across 22 countries.

In the future, POKT Network's protocol could serve any open-data source.

### Our Purpose is to:

> #### _Provide the world with unstoppable open data_

We believe that the economies of the future will run on blockchain technology and we want the infrastructure that powers that to be owned by users, not corporations.

### Our Mission is to:

> #### _Empower developers with access to the most reliable, performant and cost-effective data_

To access POKT Network decentralized infra, you need to go through a 'Gateway'.&#x20;

This reduces friction when interacting with the protocol and also enables businesses to build on top of our robust RPC base layer, while optimizing Quality of Service (QoS) and innovating to bring new features and services to you and to our ecosystem. &#x20;

Once the Shannon Upgrade launches it will become permissionless to build a Gateway on our infrastructure, including the ability to deploy a Gateway directly for a specific application if that is how you prefer to access the protocol.

For more on Gateways, see [here](broken-reference).

### Our Vision is:

> #### _A future where the world’s most important digital infrastructure is owned and governed by its users_

This is our project roadmap driving us in the future to continue our mission:&#x20;

## History of $POKT

POKT Network was launched with the aim of decentralizing the RPC layer of the Web3 stack. Pocket is the only decentralized RPC network on mainnet today that's supply-side permissionless. After the Shannon upgrade later this year, it will be the only one that's demand-side permissionless as well.

POKT launched its mainnet on July 28th, 2020, with 650m POKT tokens created at genesis. The amount of POKT minted is directly proportional to the number of proven data relays in a given block, with the compensation divided between service nodes, validator nodes, and the POKT Network DAO that governs the protocol.

## POKT is first and foremost a utility token

* POKT is used to incentivize and facilitate the operation of Gateways and POKT nodes.
* Staking POKT underpins the network's digital infrastructure that is owned and governed by its users.
* POKT allows you to act as a Liquidity Provider for our decentralized RPC ecosystem.
