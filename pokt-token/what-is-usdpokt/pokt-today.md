# POKT Today

The vast majority of POKT's supply is now liquid and circulating, with most tokens - almost 1b (and counting) of the current supply - distributed permissionlessly since POKT Network’s mainnet launch on 28 July 2020. The distribution mechanism - POKT Network’s version of a fair launch à la Bitcoin - was to issue POKT rewards to those staking POKT as node runners to serve RPC requests and as validators to secure the network.

POKT's latest supply schedule is dictated by [ARR (Accelerating the Road to Revenue)](https://forum.pokt.network/t/pup-32-accelerating-the-road-to-revenue-arr/4494), a proposal that passed on 5 July 2023. This schedule targets an average mint rate of 220,000 POKT per day**,** which varies based on the 7-day trailing average of relay requests to the network as per [ACCURATE](https://forum.pokt.network/t/pup-29-a-cadence-change-to-updates-of-rttm-adjustment-for-target-emissions-accurate/3777), a proposal adopted on 25 January 2023, which includes the calculator used to update the mint rate weekly.

All POKT minted in each block is distributed as follows:

* 85% to the node runners for serving the relays
* 5% to the validators for securing the network
* 10% to the DAO treasury

**Supply projections**

_Note: this chart is based on the current cap. We are targeting deflation by the end of 2025._&#x20;
