# Voting Rubric

A Rubric is provided to help assess impact using evidence provided by the projects. The rubric is scored 1-5 across a number of dimensions. Voters should consider that projects:

* Scoring mostly 5 across the dimensions might be considered for the Highest Impact tier
* Scoring mostly 4 across the dimensions should be considered for the High Impact tier
* Scoring mostly 3 across the dimensions should be considered for the Medium Impact tier
* Scoring mostly 2 across the dimensions should be considered for the Low Impact tier
* Scoring mostly 1 across the dimensions should be considered No Impact and excluded.

Below are the rubrics for each category.  An excel version is linked [here ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1x-SlJMvWpIiEeabB5wHjXupYZKBS5MoV\_zLMDGS2zD0/edit#gid=0)
