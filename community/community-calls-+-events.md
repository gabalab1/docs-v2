#### Ecosystem Calls

Ecosystem calls are held every Wednesday at noon EST on the [POKT Discord server](https://discord.gg/pocket-network). This is an open forum for PNF and all ecosystem participants to discuss any progress updates, ideas, questions, or concerns. All calls are recorded and posted for those who cannot attend.
