# Applying for Funding

Submit a proposal on the POKT Forum for an [Event Funding request](https://forum.pokt.network/c/build/events/123). You will need to include in your proposal the following:

1. Description of your event
2. Location and date
3. **Expected impact** of your event and how it supports [our 2024 ambitions](https://forum.pokt.network/t/pnf-ecosystem-strategy-and-ambitions-update/4836)
4. Your confirmed speakers and their presentation topics
5. Proposed simple budget
6. Type of event grant requested:
   * Mini Event - $100
   * Mid-sized Event - $500
   * Large Event - $1,000+ (approved on a case-by-case basis)
7. **Link** to where your work will be stored or reported (Notion, GitHub, Forum topic thread or Karma)
8. **ETH Wallet** address for stables payment

**What happens next?** PNF’s Head of Community will review your Grant, typically within 48-72 hours. They may approve it, adjust the value, ask for more information, or deny it. If it is approved, they’ll let you know when you’re approved to start work (the day pay begins) and when you can expect your first payment.

Approved Grants will start on the 1st and 15th of the month, and will be paid in stables.
