# Event Type

There are **three different event sizes**.&#x20;

This impacts budget, venue, requirements, and expectations: [Small Events](small-events.md), [Mid-Sized Events](mid-sized-events.md), and [Large Events](large-events.md). &#x20;

Here's an overview. :point\_down:

<table><thead><tr><th width="155"></th><th>Small Events</th><th width="153">Mid Size Events</th><th>Large Events</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>For Whom</strong></td><td><em>You're new to hosting events</em></td><td><em>You have some events experience</em></td><td><em>You're a pro at hosting events</em></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Attendees</strong></td><td>8-30 Attendees</td><td>31-100 Attendees</td><td>>100 Attendees</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Funding Available</strong></td><td>$100</td><td>$500</td><td>$1,000+</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Requirements</strong></td><td>Citizen Cred</td><td>Citizen Cred</td><td>Pre-Approval required. Must have hosted 2 successful Mid Size Events previously.</td></tr></tbody></table>

If you're **just getting started** with your first event as a host, we recommend you start with **hosting a small event**. \
\
If you have **some experience** organizing and hosting a couple of events in the past, the **mid-sized event** type would be an ideal event to choose. Both of these event types will give you the confidence to run your first and future successful events.&#x20;

Hosting a larger event can be more complicated, and will require that you have several volunteers, especially if you have multiple speakers and activities at the event.&#x20;

**Pro tip:** Regardless of the size of an event, keep it simple! is easier for you to manage, and for your attendees and speakers to participate. Don't over complicate things, and get a couple of friends to help.
