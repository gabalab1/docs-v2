# POKT Events Playbook

We're here to help you create and host an event that empowers your audience to learn about POKT Network and about DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure) in general.

Hosting an event is a great way to boost your network and build your profile, while bringing value to your local community and helping us grow awareness about POKT Network and the global DePIN movement.

**Pro tip:** the most important focus is your audience and why they should give you their time. We're here to help you figure that out.

If you want to join us on this journey, we'll provide tools, best practices, checklists, resources and templates to make hosting a great in-person event easy, regardless of your event management experience. We'll even throw in some budget. ☺️

This playbook will take you from zero to event-host hero.
