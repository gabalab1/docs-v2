# POKT Rewards

There are two primary ways to earn $POKT rewards by supporting the Pocket Network ecosystem:

## <mark style="color:blue;">1. Run a POKT Node</mark>

By running a POKT node yourself, or using a Node Provider, POKT holders are able to generate rewards.

### Node Running Info

| POKT Required                | 15k, 30k, 45k, or 60k (same reward % for reach)               |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Expected Annual Return (APR) | 10% to 40% (depending on network traffic)                     |

## <mark style="color:blue;">2. Liquidity Mining</mark>

Another way to earn $POKT is by supplying liquidity to official POKT liquidity pools on decentralized exchanges (DEXs). Liquidity pools are essential for providing better access to $POKT users.

These liquidity pools have a POKT reward attached to them. When more volume is on the pool, more rewards are given to the LP participants.
