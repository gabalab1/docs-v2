# $POKT Token

## <mark style="color:blue;">POKT's Native Chain</mark>

POKT has its own native Layer-1 blockchain built using Tendermint. The $POKT token plays two key roles in the protocol:

1. **Payments**: $POKT is used to pay node runners for servicing data requests. Gateways pay a small fee in $POKT for each request relayed through the network.
2. **Staking**: Node runners must stake $POKT to participate in servicing requests. Staking aligns economic incentives and secures the network.

Users can buy POKT for the native blockchain through a number of exchanges:

* [KuCoin](https://www.kucoin.com/trade/POKT-USDT?rcode=e21sNJ)
* [Gate.io](https://www.gate.io/trade/POKT\_USDT?ref=3018394)
* [Upbit](https://upbit.com/exchange?code=CRIX.UPBIT.BTC-POKT)
* [Bybit](https://www.bybit.com/trade/spot/POKT/USDT/?affiliate\_id=9763)

## <mark style="color:blue;">Multi-Chain POKT</mark>

$POKT is not just limited to it's own L1, as it also exists on a growing number of DeFi enabled L1s and L2s thanks to [POKT's Multi-Chain Bridge](bridging/#pokt-bridge). These POKT tokens can be held in any wallet that is compatible with the host chain.

POKT's multi-chain smart contract was audited by [Nethermind](https://github.com/pokt-network/pocket-contracts/blob/cb4b5bb7a7bc9c24e63ddde66f7914185f0b4295/audits/NM0245\_XPOKT.pdf) and can be found on the following chains and DeFi platforms:

### <mark style="color:orange;">Growing a Multi-Chain Community</mark>

To jumpstart adoption across the newly supported chains, POKT is offering incentives for users to provide liquidity on decentralized exchanges. These [liquidity mining programs](pokt-rewards/#id-2.-liquidity-staking) aim to boost $POKT's accessibility and market depth as the multi-chain ecosystem grows.
