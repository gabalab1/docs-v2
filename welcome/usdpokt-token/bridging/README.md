# Bridging

## [<mark style="color:blue;">POKT Bridge</mark>](https://bridge.pokt.network/)

POKT has a [native multi-chain bridge](https://bridge.pokt.network/) to allow the easy moving of POKT tokens between chains.

Bridge in 3 steps:

1. Connect your wallet.\

## <mark style="color:blue;">wPOKT Bridge</mark>

POKT uses a bridge token called wPOKT to go from POKT's native L1 to other chains (like Ethereum, Base, etc).

The flow looks like this:

<mark style="color:purple;">**POKT blockchain**</mark>  <- ->  <mark style="color:orange;">**wPOKT**</mark>**  <- ->  **<mark style="color:green;">**POKT on Ethereum, Base, etc**</mark>

{% hint style="info" %}
_NOTE: With the_ [_Shannon upgrade_](../../../pokt-protocol/the-shannon-upgrade/)_, the wPOKT bridge token will no longer be required. wPOKT will be phased out as POKT will be able to go between all chains natively._
{% endhint %}

For users wanting to stake POKT on a node, they may need to utilize the wPOKT bridge to transfer POKT from another chain back to POKT's native blockchain.\
